# Welcome to Recollect

Recollect is a simple Record Collection Manager written in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) using the [Phoenix Framework](http://phoenixframework.org/). It uses PostgreSQL.

Elixir and Phoenix have been inspired by and compared to Ruby and Rails, but they are [faster](https://littlelines.com/blog/2014/07/08/elixir-vs-ruby-showdown-phoenix-vs-rails). See also [here](https://github.com/mroth/phoenix-showdown).

## Third-Party Software

* [Scrivener](https://github.com/drewolson/scrivener) - for pagination
